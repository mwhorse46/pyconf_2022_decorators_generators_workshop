# What are we gonna cover ?

- `decorators`
- `generators`

There `importance` and `applications`. ...

# What is a `Decorator` ?

As per docs, `A decorator is a design pattern in Python` that allows a user to `add new functionality` to `an existing object` without `modifying its structure`.

---

# Why `Decorator` ?

Let us understand with an example.

Say you have a function `abc` which is working absolutely fine. You now want to add an additional functionality to `log time`. You went ahead and modified code. Now say you have a hundred functions and you want to modify each one of them ?

This is where `decorator` helps !

# Applications of `Decorator`

- Adding validation layer.
- Wrapping up objects/ Proxying.
- Registering plugins.
- Extending functionality.
- Dependancy injection.

... _many more_.

# Lets talk more on `decorators`

We may code along as we discuss this in detail. Below link would include all the source code.

# What is a `Generator` ?

`generator functions` are a special kind of function that return a lazy iterator.

---

# Why `Generator` ?

Lets consider this code segment

```python
def csv_reader(file_name):
    file = open(file_name)
    result = file.read().split("\n")
    return result
```

This reads a `csv` file and returns list of the lines. This may be okay for small file but consider file to be `gb's` in size. Is it okay to load everything at once or read it lazily as and when required ?

This is where generator helps you with, iterating over the object lazily.

---

# `Generators` Over `Iterators` ?

Though `Generators` are subclass of `Iterators`, they are more handy and compact. Unlike `Iterators`, which require `__iter__` and `__next__` methods, generators are simple functions with `yield` statement.

```python
>>> import collections,types
>>> issubclass(types.Generator,collections.Iterator)
>>> True
```

`Generators` also save local state of the function (variable binding, instruction sets ...) when execution pauses.

---

# Magical `yield` keyword

When we call a generator function, it returns a `generator object` that can be stored in a variable. When we call `next()` on this generator object, execution starts and suspends till it reaches `yield` keyword.

This also initializes the generator object, so that other generator methods like `send()`, `throw()` and `close()` can be called.

`yield` can also consume values using `send()` method on `generator object`.

**Note**: _We will need to initialize generator object by calling `next` method, before we can use `send()`_.

---

# Facts about `generators`

- `generators` also gets exhausted like an `iterator` object and raises `StopIteration` Exception. When looped over, this exception is automatically handled by construct.

- `generator objects` can only be used once i.e. they cannot be reused once exhausted.

_Note: `StopIteration` is a natural exception thatâ€™s raised to signal the end of an iterator._
