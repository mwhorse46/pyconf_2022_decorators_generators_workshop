# `Decorators` and `Generators`: Control your code with ease

`Decorators` are very powerful and super handy constructs in Python when it comes to write re-usable code and controlled flow. `Generators` comes in handy when you want to iterate over a objects saving memory and preserving state. Both of these constructs are easy to implement and can save lot of lines of code as well as optimise performance.

Most of the Python developers know or would have heard of above mentioned `constructs` but only a few know how they are used. This becomes a `bottleneck` while working in frameworks or libraries, due to lack of understanding and thus developers cannot make best utilisation of the existing code.

This workshop would help people to implement `decorators` and `generators` like a pro.

### Decorators

---

Decorators can help ease code development by making code reusable, implemeting single entry points for the workflow, caching, registering plugins etc. Below are the list of topics that would be covered:

- Functional Decorators
  - Simple Decorators ( Basic )
  - Decorator with Arguments
- Class based Decorators
  - Simple Descorators ( Basic )
  - Decorator with Arguments
  - Descriptors as Decorators
- Decorator Chaining
- Applications
  - Extending existing functionality using decorators.
  - Access Control using decorators (Security).
  - Wrapping Function into Classes using Decorators.
  - Registering plugins using Decorators.
  - Dependancy Injection using Decorators.
  - Working of Route Decorator ( FastAPI & Flask ).
  - Creating @property decorator.
  - Converting generators to context managers.

### Generators

---

Generators can help optimise code when you need to iterate over a large object and save some memory. They are very easy to implement and iterate over. Below are the list of topics that would be covered:

- `yield` keyword.
- Basic Generator Implementation.
- `yield from` expressions in `generators`.
- `generator` expressions.
- Reading file using generators.
- Generators advanced methods:
  - `send` method ( coroutines )
  - `throw` method ( Custom Exceptions )
  - `close` method ( Closing Generator )
- Using generators with `context managers`.

---

The above mentioned topics would cover constructs completely and would help attendee's gain confidence to use them in their source code.

Repository will contain the hands-on source code._
> Candidate should hold basic knowledge for **`Python`**.
